NDAP Clone
This project is a full-stack web application that clones the core functionalities of the National Data and Analytics Platform (NDAP). It features a React-based frontend for a dynamic user interface and a Node.js/Express backend to handle API requests and business logic.

‚ú® Features
User Interface Clone: A faithful recreation of the NDAP portal's look and feel.

Backend API: A robust API built with Node.js and Express to serve data.

Modular Structure: A clean separation between the frontend and backend code for better maintainability.

Dataset Display: Functionality to display datasets in a clean, grid-based layout.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: (Please specify your database, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js (which includes npm)

Git

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/Anmol08-dev/ndap-clone.git](https://github.com/Anmol08-dev/ndap-clone.git)

Navigate to the project's root directory:

cd ndap-clone

Setting up the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create an environment file: Create a file named .env in the backend directory. Here you will store sensitive information like your database connection string and any API keys.

# Example .env file
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string_here"

Start the backend server:

npm start

The server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.

Setting up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window. Make sure you are in the project's root directory (ndap-clone).

Navigate to the frontend folder:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the React application:

npm start

The frontend development server will start, and the application should automatically open in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
